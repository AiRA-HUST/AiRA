We are excited to announce that AiRA Lab is presenting our latest research at the **International Conference on Engineering Mechanics and Applications (ICEMA-25)**, held at **Vietnam National University (VNU), Hanoi** on **November 14, 2025**.

Our team is presenting three research papers showcasing cutting-edge work in computational mechanics and dynamic systems:

1. **Modeling of the Flexible Inverted Pendulum via Pseudo-Rigid-Body (PRB)**: Advanced modeling techniques for flexible mechanical systems using pseudo-rigid-body approaches

2. **Exploring PD Control Effects on the Basins of Attraction in Segway Dynamics**: Investigation of proportional-derivative control strategies and their impact on dynamic stability regions

3. **Dynamic Behavior of Kresling Origami under Harmonic Excitation: A Five-Parameter Energy Framework**: Comprehensive analysis of origami structures under dynamic loading using novel energy-based modeling
