Nguyen Trong Giap is an undergraduate student in the Department of Mechatronics at the School of Mechanical Engineering, Hanoi University of Science and Technology. He is actively involved in research activities at the AiRA Laboratory, specializing in soft and flexible robotics systems with a focus on AI-enhanced modeling and control.

His research interests center on continuum robotics, flexible inverted pendulum systems, and other soft robotic mechanisms that exhibit complex nonlinear dynamics. Giap is particularly focused on leveraging artificial intelligence to advance the modeling of these flexible systems, developing novel approaches that can capture their intricate behaviors more accurately than traditional methods.

His work involves creating AI-driven models for continuum robots that can bend, twist, and deform in multiple directions, as well as studying flexible inverted pendulum dynamics for applications in soft manipulation and adaptive control. By integrating machine learning techniques with advanced mechanical modeling, Giap aims to develop intelligent control strategies that can effectively manage the complex dynamics of soft and flexible robotic systems, enabling more precise and adaptive robotic behaviors in real-world applications.
