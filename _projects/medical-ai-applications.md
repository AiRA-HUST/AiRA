## Project Overview

This project develops artificial intelligence methods for automated single-cell annotation and spatial transcriptomics analysis. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, we aim to accelerate cellular phenotype identification, uncover spatial organization patterns in tissues, and provide computational tools that enable researchers to extract deeper biological insights from high-dimensional genomic data.

## Goals

- **Automated Cell Type Annotation**: Develop AI models for accurate and rapid cell type identification in single-cell RNA sequencing data
- **Spatial Pattern Discovery**: Create algorithms to identify and characterize spatial cellular organization and cell-cell interactions
- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Build frameworks that integrate single-cell transcriptomics with spatial information for comprehensive tissue analysis
- **Therapeutic Target Identification**: Apply AI to discover cellular states and spatial niches relevant to disease progression and treatment resistance

## Key Research Areas

### Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis
- **Deep Learning for Cell Annotation**: Transformer-based and graph neural network architectures for automated cell type classification
- **Cell State Identification**: Detection of rare cell populations, transitional states, and therapy-resistant subpopulations
- **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging large reference datasets to enable accurate annotation across tissues and disease contexts
- **Trajectory Inference**: AI-guided reconstruction of cellular differentiation and state transition pathways

### Spatial Transcriptomics
- **Spatial Pattern Recognition**: Identifying tissue architecture, cellular neighborhoods, and microenvironmental niches
- **Cell-Cell Interaction Modeling**: Predicting ligand-receptor interactions and intercellular communication networks
- **Spatial Domain Segmentation**: Unsupervised and semi-supervised methods for tissue region identification
- **Multi-Scale Analysis**: Integration of cellular and tissue-level spatial features for comprehensive understanding

## Applications in Cancer Biology

Our methods are particularly focused on understanding cancer heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance:

- **Drug-Tolerant Persister Cells**: Identifying rare persister cell populations that survive therapy and drive relapse
- **Tumor Microenvironment Mapping**: Characterizing immune, stromal, and malignant cell interactions in spatial context
- **Treatment Response Prediction**: Using single-cell and spatial features to predict therapeutic outcomes
- **Biomarker Discovery**: Discovering cellular signatures and spatial patterns associated with disease progression
