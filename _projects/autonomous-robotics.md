## Project Overview

Our Autonomous Robotics project focuses on advancing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to create smarter, more adaptive robots capable of intuitive interaction. This research bridges perception, language understanding, and real-world action for the next generation of autonomous robotics systems.

## Goals

- **Intelligent Perception**: Develop advanced computer vision systems for robot environmental understanding
- **Language Integration**: Create robots that can understand and respond to natural language instructions
- **Adaptive Control**: Build control systems that can adapt to new environments and tasks
- **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Bridge the gap between simulation and real-world robot deployment

## Key Research Areas

- **Vision-Language-Action Models**: Integration of multimodal AI for comprehensive robot intelligence
- **Real-World Adaptation**: Techniques for robots to adapt to unstructured environments
- **Human-Robot Interaction**: Natural and intuitive interfaces for robot collaboration
- **Autonomous Decision Making**: AI systems for independent robot task planning and execution
