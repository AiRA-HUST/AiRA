## Project Overview

Our Origami-Inspired Designs project leverages the ancient art of paper folding to create innovative engineering solutions. By harnessing folding geometry principles, we develop lightweight, flexible, and multifunctional mechanisms for soft robotics, deployable systems, and bio-inspired actuation.

## Goals

- **Geometric Innovation**: Apply origami folding patterns to engineering design challenges
- **Lightweight Structures**: Create high-performance systems with minimal material usage
- **Deployable Systems**: Develop structures that can transform from compact to expanded configurations
- **Bio-Inspired Solutions**: Learn from nature's folding mechanisms for engineering applications

## Key Research Areas

- **Folding Mechanics**: Understanding the physics and mathematics of origami transformations
- **Smart Materials**: Integration of responsive materials with origami structures
- **Soft Robotics**: Application of origami principles to flexible robotic systems
- **Deployable Architecture**: Large-scale structures that can be compactly stored and deployed
